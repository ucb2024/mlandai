README Summary: Used Car Pricing Analysis

Overview

In this project, we delve into a Kaggle dataset comprising information on 426,000 used cars, aiming to discern the factors influencing their prices. Employing the CRISP-DM framework, we convert this business question into a regression problem, with the objective of constructing a predictive model to estimate used car prices.

Data Understanding

To understand the dataset, we follow these steps:

Get an Overview:
Display the first few rows to understand the structure.
Check data types, missing values, and summary statistics.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Explore the distribution of the target variable (Price).
Visualize relationships between price and variables like year, mileage, engine size, fuel type, transmission, and drive system.
Data Preparation

Preparing the data involves:

Handling Missing Values:
Drop rows with missing values.
Encoding Categorical Variables:
Convert categorical variables into numerical format.
Scaling Numerical Features:
Scale numerical features like year, odometer, and engine size.
Modeling

Build regression models to predict car prices:

Split Data:
Divide the data into features (X) and the target variable (y).
Split the data into training and test sets.
Linear Regression Model:
Initialize and fit a linear regression model.
Make predictions and evaluate model performance using mean squared error.
Evaluation

Evaluate the model and insights:

Visualize Predictions:
Plot predicted vs. actual prices.
Residual Analysis:
Explore the distribution of residuals.
Feature Importance:
Identify and visualize the importance of different features.
Deployment

Generate a report with key findings and recommendations for the used car dealership. Key components include:

Key Findings:
Highlight top influential features.
Report model performance metrics.
Recommendations:
Optimize inventory based on influential features.
Refine pricing strategies for different car categories.
Enhance customer communication based on pricing factors.
The final report is saved in a user-friendly markdown format for easy sharing and presentation.
