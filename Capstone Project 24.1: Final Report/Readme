Heart Disease Classification Project

1. Background Research

Heart disease, a collective term for conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels, encompasses prevalent forms like coronary artery disease, heart valve disease, and heart failure. Current preventive and treatment strategies involve lifestyle adjustments (healthy diet, exercise, and smoking cessation) and medications such as statins, blood pressure medications, and anticoagulants. Interventional procedures like angioplasty or bypass surgery are employed for advanced cases.

Research into heart disease has improved our understanding of causes and risk factors. Major risks include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, and family history. Lifestyle factors like diet and physical activity significantly impact heart disease development. Recent efforts focus on innovative treatments like minimally invasive surgeries and stem cells for heart tissue repair.

The field of heart disease research is dynamic, with continual advancements in findings and treatments.

2. Objective

The primary objective is to perform classification (Diseased or Not Diseased) on the provided data and identify the best model with the highest accuracy.

3. Dataset Data Dictionary

age: Age of persons
sex: Gender of persons (1 = male; 0 = female)
cp: Chest pain type (4 values)
trtbps: Resting blood pressure
chol: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
fbs: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
restecg: Resting electrocardio results (values 0,1,2)
thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved
exng: Exercise-induced angina
oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
slp: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment
